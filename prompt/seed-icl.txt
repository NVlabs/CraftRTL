Your goal is to create a high-quality Verilog problem.

* Guidelines for designing the problem description:

1. This should be **completely self-contained**, providing all the contextual information one needs to understand and solve the problem.
2. Assume common verilog knowledge, but ensure that any specific context, variables, or code snippets pertinent to this problem are explicitly included.
3. Do not include the code snippet in the problem.
4. The problem should be desinged for the programmers to solve it with one verilog module.
5. The problem description section should be enclosed within <PROBLEM> </PROBLEM> tags.


Below shows some examples:


<PROBLEM>
{icl_problem}
</PROBLEM>



Now, Please use your creativity to create a brand new high-quality Verilog problem.
